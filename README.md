- The average temperature in June was 3.9 degrees higher than December.
- The max temperature in June was 2 degrees higher than December. 
- The min temperature has the greatest difference of 8 degrees.

### Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

Overall, the temperature in June and December were very similar. December's temperatures had a wider range but the average and high tempuratures were remarkably similar. I would like to perform additional queries on precipitation for all months and also find temperature and precipitation results by station location to determine which station is closest to our ideal surf shop location.
